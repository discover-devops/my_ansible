Let me explain this **in detail**, step-by-step, using your diagram:

---

## Ansible Architecture (As per Your Diagram)

### 1. **Control Node (MASTER)**

* This is the machine where **Ansible is installed**.
* It's responsible for sending configuration tasks to other machines using **SSH**.
* Often referred to as the **Ansible Master** or **Controller**.

> You only install Ansible on the Control Node.
> No Ansible agent is needed on target machines.

---

### 2. **Managed Nodes (App / DB Server)**

* These are the **target servers** where actual configurations will be applied (e.g., installing Apache, setting up DB users).
* Also called **Slaves** (older terminology), or simply **Inventory hosts**.

Examples:

* `App` → Web server (e.g., NGINX, Apache)
* `DB Server` → MySQL/PostgreSQL, etc.

---

### 3. **SSH Connection (Important Requirement)**

> **Secure and Agentless**

* Ansible uses **SSH** to connect to managed nodes.
* There is **no agent** running on these nodes.
* The control node executes tasks **remotely over SSH**.

**You must:**

* Ensure SSH keys are exchanged or password auth is enabled.
* Use `ansible_user`, `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` if needed in your inventory.

---

### 4. **Python Requirement**

> Python is required on both **control** and **managed nodes**

* Why?

  * Ansible uses Python on the target node to execute its modules (like `copy`, `yum`, `service`, etc.).
  * Even basic commands like checking disk usage or copying a file run via Python backend.

Most Linux distributions already come with Python installed. If not, you need to install it.

## What Happens Internally?

Let’s say you write a **Playbook** like:

```yaml
- name: Install Apache on App Server
  hosts: app
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
```

This is what happens:

1. You run the playbook from the Control Node using:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook install_apache.yml
   ```

2. Ansible connects via SSH to the **App server**.

3. It pushes temporary Python code to the target machine.

4. Executes that code via the Python interpreter on the managed node.

5. Cleans up once the task is complete.

All of this is **stateless and agentless**.

## Summary Table

| Component    | Role                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Control Node | Runs Ansible CLI, sends tasks               |
| Managed Node | Receives tasks, executes via Python         |
| SSH          | Communication layer                         |
| Python       | Required on both sides for module execution |
| Agent        | ❌ Not required (unlike Puppet or Chef)      |
