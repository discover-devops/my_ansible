## How Ansible Works Internally (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: **Install Ansible (Control Node)**

* You install Ansible on a **Linux system** (your control/master node).
* During installation, **Ansible core, plugins, and built-in modules** are made available locally.

  * Modules are Python scripts used for tasks like creating users, installing packages, copying files, etc.
  * Inventory file (INI, YAML, or dynamic) lists your target hosts.

---

### Step 2: **Ansible Uses Modules to Do Specific Tasks**

* Each **Ansible module** is a **Python script** (or sometimes written in PowerShell for Windows tasks).
* Examples:

  * `user` module → manages users
  * `yum`, `apt` → install packages
  * `copy`, `template`, `file` → file-level operations

**You don’t have to write Python code** — you just declare tasks in YAML (playbooks) and Ansible uses these modules under the hood.

---

### Step 3: **Execution Flow (Playbook or ad-hoc command)**

When you run a playbook like:

```yaml
- name: Create a user
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure user 'rahul' exists
      user:
        name: rahul
        state: present
```

Here's what happens internally:

| Process | Behind the Scenes                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Ansible connects to the target host via **SSH**                                             |
| 2.   | The relevant **module (e.g., `user.py`)** is **copied over to `/tmp/`** on the managed node |
| 3.   | Ansible **executes the module** using the remote host’s **Python interpreter**              |
| 4.   | Once the task completes, the module and temporary files are **deleted automatically**       |

**Ansible uses `scp` and `ssh`** under the hood to send and run modules (unless you're using other connection plugins like `paramiko` or `winrm`).

### Summary

| Element   | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modules   | Small programs (mostly in Python) that do specific tasks        |
| Execution | Modules copied to managed nodes using `scp`, executed via `ssh` |
| Cleanup   | After execution, temporary module files are removed             |
| Agentless | No agent needed; only SSH + Python is required                  |
